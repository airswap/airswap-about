### How is AirSwap different from Uniswap?

Uniswap is a "peer-to-contract" automated market maker (AMM) that runs fully on-chain. AirSwap is a peer-to-peer network combining off-chain negotiation and on-chain settlement by atomic swap.

There are benefits to each. With AirSwap there is no price slippage and trades are unlimited in size. The trade-off is that it's easier for everyday users to provide liquidity to Uniswap. However, a successful outcome for RFQ is a few high quality liquidity providers covering a variety of digital assets, so AirSwap does not require the same number of liquidity providers to be successful.

### Is AirSwap available on other chains?

AirSwap [RFQ ](./technology/protocols.md)is currently available through Metamask swaps on BSC. We are currently working on bringing AirSwap swaps to a [chain near you](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues/49). Stay tuned...

## Governance

### Why Stake on AirSwap?

AirSwap Tokens (AST) can be staked to participate in governance of the protocol. All are welcome to participate by proposing, discussing, and voting on proposals that move the project and community forward. Voters earn points based on the amount staked. Points can be used to claim a portion of the funds from the rewards pool.

### How do I stake on AirSwap?

You can stake your AST on the [Member Dashboard](https://dao.airswap.eth.limo/).

### What are the rules of staking?

Staked tokens are unlocked over a 20 week period with a 4 week initial cliff. This means that you may not unstake any tokens during the first 4 weeks.

### When is the next vote?

Voting occurs every month, from the 1st to the 4th of each month.

### Do my points expire?

No! Points don't expire and will be carried over to the next cycle.

### How do I unstake from V1?

This will unlock your AST and transfer it to your wallet.

1. Visit this URL to determine your balance (replace 0x000 with your wallet address):
   [https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4C5107184a88D4B324Dd10D98a11dd8037823Fe?a=0x000](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4C5107184a88D4B324Dd10D98a11dd8037823Fe?a=0x000)

2. Visit this URL, connect your wallet, go to "unlock" and provide your balance amount:
   [https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4C5107184a88D4B324Dd10D98a11dd8037823Fe#writeContract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4C5107184a88D4B324Dd10D98a11dd8037823Fe#writeContract)

Note: balances have 4 decimals so e.g. 2,500.00 would have an "unlock" amount of 25000000.
