# RFQ

AirSwap Request-for-Quote \(RFQ\) is used by market makers to provide orders with expirations. Takers will request an order periodically and have the option to fill it.

**Protocol Features**

* Taker has the option to fill an order.
* Taker is guaranteed the price until expiry.

**Protocol Summary**

RFQ is available over **HTTP** or **WebSocket**. In RFQ, servers are **signers** and clients are **senders**.

1. Client sends the server a JSON-RPC over HTTP request.
2. Server responds with a signed order.
3. Client may send the signed order to Ethereum for settlement.

For information on finding counter-parties, see [Discovery](discovery.md).

## Methods

### `initialize`

To support RFQ via WebSocket, the server must call initialize upon connection by the client and indicate `request-for-quote` among its list of supported protocols.

```typescript
initialize([
  {
    name: 'request-for-quote',
    version: '1.0.0'
  }, ...
})
```

### `getSignerSideOrder`

Given a `senderAmount` the server returns a signed order with a `signerAmount`. The client is **selling** to the server.

```typescript
getSignerSideOrder(
  senderAmount: string, // Amount the sender would transfer
  signerToken: string,  // Token the signer would transfer
  senderToken: string,  // Token the sender would transfer
  senderWallet: string, // Wallet of the sender
  swapContract: string, // Swap contract intended for use (Light)
  proxyingFor: string,  // Ultimate counterparty of the swap (Optional)
)
```

### `getSenderSideOrder`

Given a `signerAmount` the server returns a signed order with a `senderAmount`. The client is **buying** from the server.

```typescript
getSenderSideOrder(
  signerAmount: string, // Amount the signer would transfer
  signerToken: string,  // Token the signer would transfer
  senderToken: string,  // Token the sender would transfer
  senderWallet: string, // Wallet of the sender
  swapContract: string, // Swap contract intended for use (Light)
  proxyingFor: string,  // Ultimate counterparty of the swap (Optional)
)
```

## Server

A successful result containing a `LightOrder` has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| nonce | `uint256` | Unique per signer and should be sequential. |
| expiry | `uint256` | Expiry in seconds since 1 January 1970. |
| signerWallet | `address` | Wallet that sets and signs terms. |
| signerToken | `address` | Token that the signer will transfer. |
| signerAmount | `uint256` | Amount that the signer will transfer. |
| senderToken | `address` | Token that the sender will transfer. |
| senderAmount | `uint256` | Amount that the sender will transfer. |
| v | `uint8` | `v` value of the ECDSA signature. |
| r | `bytes32` | `r` value of the ECDSA signature. |
| s | `bytes32` | `s` value of the ECDSA signature. |

  }
}
```

## Protocol

For information on finding counterparties, see the [Discovery](discovery.md) protocol. With server URLs in hand, clients call `getSignerSideOrder` or `getSenderSideOrder` as JSON-RPC over HTTP requests.

```javascript
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: ...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getSignerSideOrder",
  "params": {
    "signerToken": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
    "senderWallet": "0x1FF808E34E4DF60326a3fc4c2b0F80748A3D60c2",
    "senderToken": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2",
    "senderAmount": "1000000000000000000",
    "swapContract": "0xc549a5c701cb6e6cbc091007a80c089c49595468"
  }
}
```

A response looks like the [example](request-for-quote.md#example) above. Requests can be made using curl for testing.

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"123","method":"getSignerSideOrder","params":{"signerToken":"0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7","senderWallet":"0x1FF808E34E4DF60326a3fc4c2b0F80748A3D60c2","senderToken":"0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2","senderAmount":"1000000000000000000","swapContract":"0xc549a5c701cb6e6cbc091007a80c089c49595468"}}' \
     http://localhost:3000/
```

After requesting an order, parameters are submitted as an Ethereum transaction to the `swap` function on the [Light](deployments.md) contract, which emits a `Swap` event on success.

```typescript
  function swap(
    uint256 nonce,
    uint256 expiry,
    address signerWallet,
    IERC20 signerToken,
    uint256 signerAmount,
    IERC20 senderToken,
    uint256 senderAmount,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
  ) external;
```

```typescript
  event Swap(
    uint256 indexed nonce,
    uint256 timestamp,
    address indexed signerWallet,
    IERC20 signerToken,
    uint256 signerAmount,
    uint256 signerFee,
    address indexed senderWallet,
    IERC20 senderToken,
    uint256 senderAmount
  );
```

The server may subscribe to a filter for a `Swap` event with the nonce they provided to the client.
