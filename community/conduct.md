description: Code of conduct
---

[AirSwap](https://www.airswap.xyz) is a DAO focused on decentralized trading systems. Anyone can join, contribute, and earn as a member of our development community. Everything we build is aligned with our mission and generally measured by positive impact on network health and trading volume.

We continuously create a respectful environment where people want to come, stay, and participate over the long term.

The following code of conduct extends the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org).

- **Collaborate rather than compete.** Add energy by working together, building on each other's ideas, and give without expectations. Pay it forward. Put ideas into action.
- **Discuss rather than campaign.** The best ideas are developed through iteration by openly discussing, integrating, and updating as you learn.
- **Be an ally; not an adversary.** Be patient and allow others time to listen and speak. Interact as if you’re face to face. Support other ideas as best you can.

We all work together toward community goals. AirSwap is a positive-sum project with long-term vision. Short-term, extractive behavior is not tolerated.

### Rules

- **No price talk.** Speculation is detrimental and counterproductive to our mission. Do not talk about price. Keep discussions about building, growing, and governing AirSwap.
- **Respect each other.** This community is built by people across the globe from many walks of life with many perspectives. Honor that diversity; it gives us strength.
- **Win together.** As members of the AirSwap community, we each share common goals and all share the opportunity to contribute and help AirSwap succeed.

## Principles

Decentralized governance starts with shared principles to align our decisions.

1. **Design for simplicity** — Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away. This is especially true with blockchain based technology and applications.
2. **Prioritize security** — Our work is done in an adversarial setting. While blockchain requires users to take security into their own hands, they trust AirSwap to be designed and to operate in a secure way.
3. **Decide with data** — Drive decisions with data that matters. AirSwap performance indicators are trading volume, token holders, community engagement, and tokens used for governance.
4. **Seek opportunity** — Decentralized finance is abundant with opportunities. Seek and prioritize opportunities that positively impact both AirSwap and the broader ecosystem.
5. **Win together** — Our community spans platforms across cyberspace and countries across the globe. We grow by both sharing responsibility and celebrating each success.
