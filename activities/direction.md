description: A guide to contributing to the direction of AirSwap

# Direction

## Mandate

Facilitate community discussion and transcribe the best forms of ideas into formal written proposals to be assessed by Voters.

## Scope

Contributors help to guide the direction of AirSwap by drafting AirSwap Improvement Protocols (AIPs). Any contributor is welcome to create an AIP. Each proposal must outline a problem or opportunity and specifies a solution and its tradeoffs. Proposals cover all sorts of topics like new protocols, smart contracts, network tooling, applications, marketing, tokenomics, and more!

## Examples

Contributors identify a relevant issue, or potential improvement for AirSwap. After initial brainstorming, the author creates a new topic on [GitHub](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues).

The structure of a proposal is as follows (See: [AIP 1](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues/1)). Each proposal includes a summary, specification, rationale, and copyright.

* **Summary** — A short (200 word) summary describing the proposal.
* **Rationale** — Motivations, justifications, arguments for and against.
* **Specification** — Technical specification for the proposal.
* **Copyright** — All proposals are public domain via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Examples of AIPs which have been voted on previously can be viewed on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth).

## How-to

### Coordination

During the monthly cycle, contributors discuss [open issues and proposals](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues), and solicit feedback from fellow contributors. **Collaborating with others leverages our collective knowledge and can lead to better proposals overall.**

Coordination generally takes place on two platforms:

1. Brainstorming on Discord where comments happen in real-time and community members build on each other's ideas rapidly. A great way to iterate on fresh ideas.
2. In-depth discussion on GitHub where slower moving comments contribute to our longer term memory and feedback gets integrated directly into proposals.

At the end of the cycle, contributors come to an agreement as to which AIPs (if any) are ready to be voted on. Authors are encouraged to continue iterating on proposals if they do not feel that they are ready to go up for vote yet.

AIPs called to vote will require a point-by-point summary of the proposal which will be put up on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth). Authors will work with the Admins to ensure that the summaries are easily understood by the general voting community.

### Rewards

At the end of each cycle, contributors allocate GIVE tokens on [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com) to reward others based on their contributions in that cycle. At the end of the cycle, AST rewards are paid out based on their allocation of GIVE tokens.

### Joining

Members of the AirSwap community who are interested in contributing can reach out to any Contributor in [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io). Current contributors in the Circle can nominate other members to join the Circle.

Nominees must receive 2 vouches from other contributors to be confirmed into the Circle. Members who have shown previous interactions with community members in debating and discussing AIPs will be given more consideration.

{% hint style="info" %}
All members should bear in mind the [code of conduct](../community/code-of-conduct.md) when debating and discussing ideas!
